Cruzadinha is an open-source and flutter-built cross-word app that functions locally in your browser (through the link: https://cruzadinha.netlify.com).

# How does it work

The project was inspired by Wordle and Term.ooo and, as such, a new set of words is sorted everyday.<sup><b>1</b></sup> The main goal is to discover the word marked with a star, and to do that, you need to discover the words marked by numbers, checking the tips.

## No accounts or e-mails needed

Your progress is saved locally, without the need of an account, so if you need to close the app to continue later, all your words will still be there. <sup><b>2</b></sup>


## Words

For now, the main word can be of any size, and the horizontal words are always 4 letters long.
> There are plans to increase the size of horizontal words in the future.

## Tips

Every word has a tip each. Some of them can be more literal, while others are more figurative.

## No pressure!

The purpose of the game is to relax. It's inteded to be short, and to not have a way of failling. There are no lives or chances. You can try as much as you'd like. Take your time. :)

# Additional notes

Since the project still on its beta stage, some functions may not work as it's supposed to. And that's why I would like to ask you to open an issue everytime you find a bug or a malfunction.

## Disclaimers

<b>1:</b> The set of words are static for now. Meaning there are no new sets being sorted everyday. But it's already in the works!
<b>2:</b> Because the progress is saved locally, you can't migrate your progress from a device to another. 

## Issues

If you do find a bug, you can open an issue telling me with your best words what happened and, most importantly, **how it happened**. Then I'll do my best to fix it. :)

## Suggestions

Suggestions are welcome as well. If you have an idea of what could be added to the project or what could be improved, I would really like to know it.
> Some ideas may not work very well with the project, or may be to hard to develop, so I'm sorry if I can't make your suggestion come true. :(

## Donations

Even though the project is 100% free, you can always help me by sending a change. Any value will make me very happy. :)
> I haven't figured how to make it happen yet, so it may take a while.

### To-do and improvements

The project will be under beta development while the taks below are not completed. And while some known bugs are fixed.

- - [X] Make set of words be sorted everyday;
- - [ ] Add statistics of games played;
- - [X] Add a way of sharing daily progress;
- - [ ] Improve local storage;

## 💻 Requirements

**Development:**<br>
The app was developed with flutter 3, and Dart 2.17, so you'll need those to run the project locally (if you want to make changes to the code).
